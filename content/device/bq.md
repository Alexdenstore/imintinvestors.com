# About BQ

[BQ] is the consumer facing brand of Munda Reader, S.L. a Spanish manufacturer of smartphones with presence in Germany, France, Russia and Portugal. BQ was one of the few device manufacturers that sold phones using [Ubuntu Phone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BQ_Aquaris_E5) instead of Android.

# History

After BQ had published that their Aquaris X5 Plus phone was going to get Vidhance Video Stabilization Imint confirmed the existence of a [license agreement](http://imint.se/nyheter/20160715-imint-tecknar-licensavtal-for-videostabilisering/). Although it was the very first license agreement with a device maker Imint announced it took almost a full year until the phone actually got Vidhance Video Stabilization through an firmware update.
